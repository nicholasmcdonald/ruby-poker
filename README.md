# ruby-poker
Calculates odds for Texas Hold 'em poker. This is a Ruby port of a project 
originally written in Java for CSCI-3130 (Software Engineering), in collaboration 
with Matthew Hemming, David Szabo, Justin Trainor, and David Walker.

This project is a work-in-progress, as the original is not yet complete. It
primarily serves as a test-bench for new functionality and architectural changes.

At some point in the future, ruby-poker may be integrated with a GUI and become a
stand-alone desktop poker game.

Constructive criticism welcomed!
